The Financial Services Board (FSB) will wait until after Christmas to serve papers on former Sentula Mining employees who were dismissed for alleged involvement in fraudulent activities. Gerhard van Deventer, the executive director of the FSB's market abuse directorate, said the financial regulator had completed its investigation into the restatement of financial statements at Sentula and the FSB enforcement committee was "preparing papers for the case" against certain individuals for this reason. The FSB action against Sentula was abandoned in October. "The papers will be served early next year," said Van Deventer on Friday. He could not confirm a date for the next sitting of the enforcement committee. The committee may impose unlimited penalties, compensation orders and cost orders. Such orders are enforceable as if they are judgments of the High Court of South Africa. Sentula's management have declined to mention the names of the former employees except that of Jason Holland, the former director of Scharrighuisen Opencast Mining, now known as Megacube Mining, against whom Sentula has filed criminal charges and a civil suit for allegedly defrauding the company of R242 million. At their meeting on Friday, Sentula executives Robin Berry and Deon Louw reiterated their stance of not commenting to "avoid jeopardising the (criminal) case". According to Van Deventer four people were being investigated - two former directors of Sentula and two directors of two Sentula subsidiaries. Business Report on Friday could not reach representatives of the JSE, which has also launched an investigation. - Asha Speckman

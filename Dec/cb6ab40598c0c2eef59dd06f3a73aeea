Maritzburg United were held to a 1-1 draw by Moroka Swallows at the Woodburn Stadium on Sunday afternoon after David Radebe scored a late equaliser to salvage a point for the visiting Birds. Maritzburg took the lead in the 53rd minute, courtesy of a Bageta Dikulu penalty. Swallows started the game in 11th position with 26 points, the same number as their hosts who sat a position below them on the standings. The result sees the visitor's winless streak stretch to seven. The last time Swallows tasted victory was after their 3-1 win against Lamontville Golden Arrows in Chatsworth, during the early part of November. During the goalless first half, the home team generally dominated proceedings and made a few threatening raids on goals. Swallows keeper, Greg Etafia was called into action as early as the  second minute when he had to keep out Dikulu's testing header from around the penalty spot. Etafia made another brilliant save six minutes later, this time he blocked a stinging drive from Fadlu Davids. Swallows came to life midway through the half and should and could have taken the lead in the 28th minute had their well travelled striker, Siyabonga Novemte, not shot over the crossbar from five metres away. Davids tested Etafia's reflexes with seconds remaining in the first half with a sweetly struck shot from just outside the penalty area, but the keeper parried the shot to safety. United continued with their zestful showing in the second half and were rightfully awarded a penalty by referee Charl Theron, when Kurt Leintjies' promising raid into the Swallows penalty area was impeded by Ramahlehla Mphalele. Dikulu made no mistake with the resulting spot kick. Just when it seemed like Swallows would be returning to Soweto empty handed, Nomvete surged towards United's goal and unleashed a shot which keeper Shuib Walters parried into the path of on-rushing  Radebe. The striker responded with a composed finish. - Sapa
